const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysis = "This is the second step when you would determine the system and software requirments."
const design = "This is the third step, in which, typically the UX team, would design the layout and funcationality of the application. In addtion to the layout of the app, this phase will also determine the visual design of the app"
const implementation = "This is the fourth step where the software and web development code the application according to the requirments and desgin that had taken place previously."
const testingIntegration = "This is the fifth step where the QA team will test the application to look for bugs that need addressed before it is released to the public."
